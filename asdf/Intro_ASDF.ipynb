    "What's wrong with FITS?\n",
    "\n",
    "  FITS served the astronomical community very well for many years. However, with the advanace of new instrumentation, development of algorithms and increased size of data and data volume it appears to be more problematic than helpful. The issues with FITS have been documented in a paper by B. Thomas, et al. (Learning from FITS: Limitations in use in modern astronomical research, Astron. Comput. (2015), 10.1016/j.ascom.2015.01.009, arXiv:1502.00996v2).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The specific motivation for developing the standard was that FITS WCS conventions proved basically unusable for raw HST data that included complex distortion models and that required high accuracy. The experience with HST showed that those conventions will not work with the much more complex JWST WCS transforms.\n",

    "### Main Features of ASDF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has a hierarchical metadata structure, made up of basic dynamic data types such as strings, numbers, lists and mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attribute names and values are not constrained by size as is the case for FITS header cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has human-readable metadata that can be edited directly in place in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The structure of the files can be automatically validated using associated schema files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s designed for extensibility: new conventions may be used without breaking backward compatibility with tools that do not understand those conventions. Versioning systems are used to prevent conflicting with alternative conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The binary array data (when compression is not used) is a raw memory dump, and techniques such as memory mapping can be used to efficiently access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is possible to read and write the file in as a stream, without requiring random access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s built on top of industry standards, such as YAML and JSON Schema to take advantage of a larger community\n",
    "working on the core problems of data representation. This also makes it easier to support ASDF in new programming languages and environments by building on top of existing libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since every ASDF file has the version of the specification to which it is written, it will be possible, through careful planning, to evolve the ASDF format over time, allowing for files that use new features while retaining backward compatibility with older tools."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The python library includes optionally extensions which are able to serialize certain astropy objects - models, coordinate frames, units and quantities, tables. It can serialize GWCS objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASDF can serialized custom types, called *tags*. A little work is needed to write *Converters*, which handle the serialization to and deserialization from ASDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code for the current extensions is on Github: https://github.com/asdf-format and in the GWCS library at https://github.com/spacetelescope/gwcs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What we didn't cover \n",
    "\n",
    "ASDF is extensible. It is relatively easy to write an extension which serializes any other Python object. Tutorials are available at https://github.com/asdf-format/tutorials .\n",
    "\n",
    "ASDF supports compression and there is a mechanism to add custom compression algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASDF uses JSON schema to validate the contents of the files. If used this is a powerful way to make sure files are correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a command line tool **asdftool** which does many of the operations we've shown outside the Python interpreter. Check the options using **asdftool --help**.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASDF supports the so called **exploded form**. ASDF files can be split into one for the YAML content and one for each of the binary blocks contained within the file, facilitating easier editor access to the YAML, and independent program access to the binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The ASDF standard is documented at  https://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.2/\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation of the Python library is at https://asdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional ASDF documentation on various extensions and converters can be found at\n",
    "\n",
    "https://asdf-astropy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add support for chunking arrays using **zarr**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add support for efficient access of large files in the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualization suport\n",
    "\n",
    "- A C/C++ library, an IDL library?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add more compression options\n"
